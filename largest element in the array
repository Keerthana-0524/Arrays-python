Given an array, we have to find the largest element in the array.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = {2,5,1,3,0};
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the largest element in the array. 

Example2: 
Input: arr[] = {8,10,5,7,9};
Output: 10
Explanation: 10 is the largest element in the array.

Solution:

def largest(arr):
    largest=arr[0]
    for i in range(1,len(arr)):
        if arr[i]>largest:
            largest=arr[i]
    return largest
arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
print(largest(arr))
