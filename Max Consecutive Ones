485. Max Consecutive Ones (Leetcode)
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the arrays

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

*Solution:*

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count=0
        max_count=0
        for i in nums:
            if i==1:
                count+=1
                max_count=max(max_count,count)
            else:
                count=0
        return max_count
